Official Warning: Imminent Action Regarding Repeated Account Restrictions and Unjust Treatment

Until now, I have experienced multiple instances of account restrictions without any prior notice or post-incident explanation.
This is no longer perceived as an operational oversight but as a deliberate act of mockery and malicious intent.

All related records have been securely documented.
I am preparing to report this incident to multiple major media outlets without prior notice, either on Monday or Tuesday.

Any further actions taken against me will also be fully documented and disclosed.
