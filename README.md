Official Warning: Imminent Action Regarding Repeated Account Restrictions and Unjust Treatment

Until now, I have experienced multiple instances of account restrictions without any prior notice or post-incident explanation.
This is no longer perceived as an operational oversight but as a deliberate act of mockery and malicious intent.

All related records have been securely documented.
I am preparing to report this incident to multiple major media outlets without prior notice, either on Monday or Tuesday.

Any further actions taken against me will also be fully documented and disclosed.

Conditional Notice:
If no official response is received within 48 hours from the initial warning, the lack of engagement itself will be included in the forthcoming disclosure to media outlets and relevant parties.

Time Limit for Official Response:
Based on the notification sent on April 26, 2025, at 9:34 PM (KST),
the 48-hour deadline will expire on:

– April 28, 2025, 9:34 PM (KST)
– April 28, 2025, 5:34 AM (PDT, San Francisco Time)

If no official response is received by this time,
the matter will proceed to external disclosure without further notice.

Formal Record Notice:
The absence of an official response within the designated 48-hour period will be formally recorded.
This record may be disclosed to external auditing bodies, investors, and media, and will serve as part of the official evaluation regarding this organization’s risk management and accountability.
